Develop functionality to extract questions from the RFP document:

Identify explicit questions (e.g., sentences ending with a question mark).
Detect implicit questions or requirements (e.g., "The vendor must provide...").
Present the extracted questions in a numbered list format, grouped by section or topic.
Allow users to flag or edit questions for clarity.
What NLP techniques can be used to accurately extract both explicit and implicit questions? How can we ensure high accuracy in identifying all relevant questions?```

Prompt 5: Key Information Mapping
Copy
Create a feature to map key information from the RFP into a structured data table. The table should include:
1. Requirement ID (auto-generated)
2. Description of the requirement
3. Page reference in the document
4. Criticality (e.g., Mandatory, Optional, Nice-to-Have)
5. Deadlines or due dates (if applicable)

Ensure this information is presented in a table format that users can export to Excel or PDF. How can we design this feature for maximum accuracy and usability?```

### **Prompt 6: User Interface Design**
Design an intuitive web interface for the RFP processing tool. The interface should include:

A file upload section with drag-and-drop functionality.
A dashboard to display:
The executive summary
A list of extracted questions
A table of key requirements
Export options for the summary, questions, and requirements table (Excel, PDF).
Collaboration features, such as comments or annotations, for team reviews.
Version control to handle multiple iterations of the RFP document.
How can we design this interface to be user-friendly and visually appealing? What frameworks or tools do you recommend for front-end and back-end development?```

Prompt 7: Advanced Features
Copy
Once the core functionality is complete, Iâ€™d like to add advanced features, such as:
1. A compliance matrix that maps RFP requirements to potential responses.
2. AI-generated suggestions for responses based on the type of question or requirement.
3. A scoring system to evaluate the completeness of the response package.
4. Integration with third-party tools like CRM or proposal management software.

How can we plan for these advanced features in the initial architecture of the tool? What AI models or APIs could support these functionalities?```

### **Prompt 8: Technical Recommendations**
Considering the scope of this project, could you recommend:

The best AI models or APIs for text extraction, summarization, and question detection.
Programming languages, frameworks, or libraries for building the tool (front-end and back-end).
Cloud services for hosting and scalability.
A step-by-step development roadmap to deliver the tool incrementally, starting with basic functionality and expanding over time.

### **Prompt 9: Testing and Feedback**
How can we implement a robust testing process to ensure the tool meets user needs? Specifically:

How do we test the accuracy of text extraction, summarization, and question detection?
What user feedback mechanisms can we include to improve the tool over time?
How can we ensure the tool performs well with diverse RFP documents, including those with complex formatting or industry-specific language?

### **Prompt 10: Security and Compliance**
RFP documents often contain sensitive information. How can we ensure the tool is secure and compliant with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)? Specifically:

What measures should we take to encrypt uploaded files and processed data?
How can we implement secure user authentication and access control?
What are the best practices for logging and monitoring to detect and prevent security breaches?
