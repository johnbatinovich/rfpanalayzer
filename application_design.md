# RFP Analyzer Application Design

## Application Workflow

### 1. Document Upload and Processing
- User uploads PDF or DOCX file via drag-and-drop interface or file selector
- System validates file format and size
- Processing begins with visual progress indicator
- Text extraction preserves document structure (headings, subheadings, bullet points)
- Extracted content displayed in preview pane for verification

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis
- Document is analyzed to identify key sections
- Executive summary is generated (1-2 paragraphs)
- Questions (explicit and implicit) are extracted and categorized
- Key requirements, deadlines, and evaluation criteria are identified
- Information is organized into structured data tables

### 3. Review and Edit
- User can review and edit the executive summary
- Questions can be flagged, edited, or reorganized
- Requirements table can be modified (criticality, descriptions, etc.)
- Comments and annotations can be added for team collaboration

### 4. Export and Share
- Export options for summary, questions, and requirements (Excel, PDF)
- Version control for multiple iterations of the RFP document
- Optional integration with third-party tools (CRM, proposal management)
