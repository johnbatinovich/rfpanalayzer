# RFP Analyzer: Non-Technical Summary

## What We've Built

We've created a web-based tool that helps media companies process advertising RFP (Request for Proposal) documents automatically. This tool makes it much easier and faster to understand what advertisers are asking for in their RFPs.

## How It Works - In Simple Terms

1. **Upload a Document**: You simply drag and drop your PDF or Word document onto the webpage.

2. **Automatic Processing**: The tool reads the document and pulls out the important information.

3. **Easy-to-Read Results**: You get:
   - A short summary of what the RFP is about
   - A list of all the questions that need answers
   - A table of requirements organized by importance
   
4. **Export Options**: You can save all this information as an Excel spreadsheet or PDF report with just one click.

## Key Benefits

- **Save Time**: What used to take hours of reading and note-taking now happens in minutes.
- **Don't Miss Anything**: The tool finds hidden questions and requirements that might be easy to overlook.
- **Better Organization**: Everything is neatly organized and easy to find.
- **Easy Sharing**: Export reports to share with your team.

## No Technical Skills Required

You don't need any technical knowledge to use this tool. If you can use a website and upload a file, you can use the RFP Analyzer.

## Next Steps

1. **Try It Out**: Upload a real RFP document to see how the tool works with your actual files.

2. **Deployment Options**:
   - **Option A - Web Hosting**: We can host this tool on a web server so your team can access it from anywhere.
   - **Option B - Internal Setup**: We can install it on your company's internal servers for added security.

3. **Training**: We can provide a quick 30-minute training session for your team to get everyone comfortable with the tool.

4. **Customization**: If needed, we can customize the tool to match your specific needs:
   - Add your company branding
   - Include industry-specific terminology
   - Connect with other systems you use

## Future Enhancements

Based on your feedback, we could add these features in the future:

1. **Team Collaboration**: Allow multiple team members to work on the same RFP.
2. **Response Suggestions**: AI-generated suggestions for how to respond to questions.
3. **Integration**: Connect with your CRM or proposal management software.
4. **Mobile App**: Access the tool from your smartphone or tablet.
